    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is like fried plantains, but they're not as good and low in fat. Dip them into condiments and spices for flavor. This can be prepared as a snack or part of a bigger meal. Use infused oil for more flavor - just make sure its oil base has a high smoke point.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>100g plantains (half a plantain)</li>
      <li>3g infused oil of choice (high smoke point)</li>

      <li>salt</li>
      <li>12g or more condiments</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>

      <li>Preheat oven, toaster oven, or air fryer at 450F or higher if possible.</li>
      <li> Boil plantain slices in broth or water mixed with salt and spices. Start with just enough water to cover the plantains.</li>
      <li>Remove plantains from water. You can keep the starchy water for the condiment mix, or use in another dish. It's good.</li>
